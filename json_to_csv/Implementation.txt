# How to implement this code

1. Load the json file into a variable using `with open('file.json') as f:` and then use `data = json.load(f)` to load it.
2. Recursive Flattening Function 
    1. Traverse through the json structure.
    2. if a value is an object, continue flattening by appending its key to the parent key.
    3. if a value is an array, treat each element as a seperate row (expand it)

Flatten All Rows:
    1. Iterate over the json data (if it's a list) and flatten each row.
    




Converting a JSON file to a CSV file involves a series of steps to parse the JSON data structure and then format it into a tabular form suitable for CSV. Here's how you can achieve that:

Step-by-Step Guide
Understand Your JSON Structure

JSON data can come in various structures:
Simple key-value pairs.
Nested objects.
Arrays of objects.
Identify the specific structure of your JSON to determine how to extract and flatten the data.
Load the JSON File

Use a programming language like Python, JavaScript, or any tool that supports JSON parsing.
Read the JSON file into memory using a JSON parsing library.
Normalize the JSON

If the JSON contains nested objects or arrays, flatten the structure to create a row-column format.
For example, in Python, libraries like pandas or custom functions can be used to handle nested data.
Extract Headers

Identify the keys from the JSON objects to form the CSV headers.
For nested data, use dot notation (e.g., parent.child) or another convention to indicate relationships.
Write to CSV

Once the JSON is flattened into a list of dictionaries or a similar structure, write the data into a CSV file.
Most programming languages have built-in libraries (e.g., Python's csv, Node.js's fs) or external packages to handle CSV writing.
Handle Edge Cases

Missing keys: Fill with default values (e.g., empty strings or null).
Data types: Ensure all values are properly formatted as strings for CSV compatibility.
Verify the Output

Open the generated CSV file to ensure the data is correctly formatted and complete.
Optional Enhancements

Add arguments or options for users to customize the input/output file paths.
Include error handling for cases like malformed JSON, missing files, or permission issues.

Let's test this guide provides a general approach to converting JSON to CSV. The specifics may vary depending on the tools and languages you choose to work with.
